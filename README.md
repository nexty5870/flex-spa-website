### ðŸ”¥ About this project

As I'm learning the basic and before using framework like tailwind I had to refresh my skills and CSS, the goal of this project #2 was to make a responsive design using Flex

This project is better then the first <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nexty5870/float-responsive-cofee"> as I used Flex and mainly REM to define the size of various element
